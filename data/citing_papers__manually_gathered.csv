In crafting this manuscript, we sought to proactively consider citation bias. Following on [70], the gender balance of citations was quantified from the first names of the first and last authors using open source code [73]. Excluding self-citations, the references for this manuscript contain 50.0% man/man, 15.1% man/woman, 21.2% woman/man, and 13.6% woman/woman citations. Expected proportions estimated from five top neuroscience journals, as reported in [70], are 58.4% man/man, 9.4% man/woman, 25.5% woman/man, and 6.7% woman/woman."

Here we sought to proactively consider choosing references that reflect the diversity of  the  field  in  thought,  form  of  contribution,  gender,  and  other  factors.  We  obtained  predicted  gender of the first and last author of each reference by using databases that store the probability of a name being carried by a woman87,90. By this measure (and excluding self-citations to the first and  last  authors  of  our  current  paper),  our  references  contain 13.9% woman/woman,  10.1% man/woman, 22.8% woman/man, and 53.2% man/man. This method is limited in that a) names, pronouns,  and  social  media  profiles  used  to  construct  the  databases  may  not,  in  every  case,  be  indicative  of  gender  identity  and  b)  it  cannot  account  for  intersex,  non-binary,  or  transgender  people.
