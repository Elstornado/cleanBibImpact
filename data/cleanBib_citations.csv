0,0,1,1,"The why, how, and when of representations for complex systems",1,arXiv:2006.02870,0,1,1,1,1,"Recent work in several fields of science has identified a bias in citation practices such that papers from women and other minorities are under-cited relative to the number of such papers in the field [63, 121, 34, 38, 198, 59].Here we sought to proactively consider choosing references that reflect the diversity of the field in thought,form  of  contribution,  gender,  and  other  factors.   Gender  bias  can  arise  due  to  explicit  and  implicit  bias against a person’s known gender as a woman, or due to explicit or implicit bias against a person carrying a name commonly used by women [118, 146, 131].  To evaluate the former (bias according to known gender),we obtained predicted gender of the first and last author of each reference using pronouns affiliated with them  online  or  pronouns  known  by  personal  friendships;  by  this  measure  (and  excluding  self-citations  to the  first  and  last  authors  of  our  current  paper),  our  references  contain  45%  man(first)/man(last),  12%man/woman,  11%  woman/man,  13%  woman/woman,  0%  non-binary  ,  and  19%  unknown  categorization.This method is limited in that pronouns may not be indicative of gender identity, and may not be consistent across time or environment.  To evaluate the latter (bias according to a gendered name), we used databases that  store  the  probability  of  a  name  being  carried  by  a  woman;  by  this  measure  (again  excluding  self-citations), our references contains 60% man/man names, 12% man/woman names, 11% woman/man names,10% woman/woman names,  and 7% unknown categorization [217, 63].  This method is limited in  that  it cannot account for intersex, non-binary, or transgender people.
